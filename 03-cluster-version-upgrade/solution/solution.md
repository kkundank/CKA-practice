# Solution

You can find a detailed description of the upgrade steps in the [offical Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-upgrade/).

## Upgrading the Control Plane Node

Shell into the control plane node.

```
$ vagrant ssh kube-control-plane
```

First, check the nodes and their Kubernetes versions. You will see that all nodes run on version 1.22.0.

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
kube-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   13m   v1.22.0
kube-worker-1        Ready    <none>                 11m   v1.22.0
```

Install the kubeadm version 1.23.4-00 and check its version.

```
$ sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.23.4-00 && sudo apt-mark hold kubeadm
kubeadm was already not hold.

kubeadm is already the newest version (1.23.4-00).
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 81 not upgraded.

$ kubeadm version
kubeadm version: &version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"23", GitVersion:"v1.23.4", GitCommit:"e6c093d87ea4cbb530a7b2ae91e54c0842d8308a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2022-02-16T12:36:57Z", GoVersion:"go1.17.7", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

Check the available versions.

```
$ sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
[upgrade/config] Making sure the configuration is correct:
[upgrade/config] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade/config] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -o yaml'
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks.

[upgrade] Fetching available versions to upgrade to
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.22.9
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.23.4
[upgrade/versions] Target version: v1.23.6
[upgrade/versions] Latest version in the v1.22 series: v1.22.9

Components that must be upgraded manually after you have upgraded the control plane with 'kubeadm upgrade apply':
COMPONENT   CURRENT       TARGET
kubelet     2 x v1.22.0   v1.23.6

Upgrade to the latest stable version:

COMPONENT                 CURRENT   TARGET
kube-apiserver            v1.22.9   v1.23.6
kube-controller-manager   v1.22.9   v1.23.6
kube-scheduler            v1.22.9   v1.23.6
kube-proxy                v1.22.9   v1.23.6

etcd                      3.5.0-0   3.5.1-0

You can now apply the upgrade by executing the following command:

	kubeadm upgrade apply v1.23.6

Note: Before you can perform this upgrade, you have to update kubeadm to v1.23.6.

_____________________________________________________________________


The table below shows the current state of component configs as understood by this version of kubeadm.
Configs that have a "yes" mark in the "MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED" column require manual config upgrade or
resetting to kubeadm defaults before a successful upgrade can be performed. The version to manually
upgrade to is denoted in the "PREFERRED VERSION" column.

API GROUP                 CURRENT VERSION   PREFERRED VERSION   MANUAL UPGRADE REQUIRED
kubeproxy.config.k8s.io   v1alpha1          v1alpha1            no
kubelet.config.k8s.io     v1beta1           v1beta1             no
